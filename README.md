We meticulously construct a comprehensive benchmark, named VisScience, which is utilized to assess the multi-modal scientific reasoning across the three disciplines of mathematics, physics, and chemistry. This benchmark comprises 3,000 questions drawn from K12 education — spanning elementary school through high school — equally distributed across three disciplines, with 1,000 questions per discipline. The questions within VisScience span 21 distinct subjects and are categorized into five difficulty levels, offering a broad spectrum of topics within each discipline.
